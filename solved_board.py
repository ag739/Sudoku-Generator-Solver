Generate a solved Sudoku board!
Using local search, the algorithm first generates a start state, and then
continues until a perfect board is achieved, or until it times out (meaning,
we've succeeded our MAXITERATIONS).
More often than not, an invalid Sudoku board is printed out.
For now, this is okay as a starting point.
